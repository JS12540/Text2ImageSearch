# Dataset Labeling and Query Preparation

## Image Annotation

Annotate each image in the dataset with relevant metadata such as make, model, year, color, body type, and any other pertinent attributes.

## Query Preparation

### Query Pool

Create a diverse set of queries covering various aspects of cars, including make, model, color, condition, environment, and activity.

### Query Difficulty

Categorize queries based on their difficulty level:
- Easy: Straightforward queries
- Moderate: Queries requiring some understanding of car attributes
- Hard: Queries involving abstract or subjective concepts

# Evaluation Procedure

## Baseline Comparison

Compare the performance of the text-to-image search system against a baseline method, such as simple keyword matching or random retrieval, to establish a reference point.

## Metrics

Use standard retrieval evaluation metrics such as Precision, Recall, and F1-score to quantify the system's performance across different queries and difficulty levels.
